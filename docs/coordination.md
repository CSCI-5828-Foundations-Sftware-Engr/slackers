# How we coordinate

## Communications
Discord and In-person

Also use stories discuss design and development decisions
## Github Project
Stories and Tasks are managed using Github Project
The specific project can be found at this [link](https://github.com/orgs/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/projects/3/).

We have two classes of issues. 
### Stories
These issues are *user stores* and are identified with the label `Stories` and can be seen in the view at this [link](https://github.com/orgs/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/projects/3/views/9).

### Tasks
These issues are technical tasks linked to stories (description of stories) and are identified with the label `Tasks` and can be seen in the view at this [link](https://github.com/orgs/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/projects/3/views/10).

### Discussion about issue
The discussion about issue should mainly be done in the issue, but some of it can spill over to and from **Discord**.

## Design Documentation

The design documentation relevant to the changes should be done as part of the Pull Request.
This should collate relevant discussions and decisions from platforms and conversations.
