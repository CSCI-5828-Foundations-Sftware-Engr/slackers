# Goals

The project aims to develop a 'social' website built around boardgames.

Although a complete version, would require a many social features, we will start with supporting a *curated* database and *automated* news feed.

## Game information

We will implement two pages, one to list to the games in the database, the other to show info about a specific game. 

## Game news feed

We will implement a game page news feed which is processed from a cron news retrieval implementation from our non-user facing analyzer and collector applications.
