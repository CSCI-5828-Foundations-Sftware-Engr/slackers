# Iteration Planning
We have broken down tasks such that each technical task should have roughly equivalent complexity, thus the points are equally weighted (i.e. we will count each task as 1 point). 

For our MVP, we anticipate roughly 10 technical tasks for user stories. Given a velocity of 5 (which we selected since we have 6 members and 5 is roughly equal), we should take 2 iterations. Note that this does not include some of our stretch goal features, including creating user accounts and tracking games. There will also likely be additional stories for testing and CI/CD infrastructure.
