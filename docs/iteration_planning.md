# Iteration Planning
We have broken down tasks such that each technical task should have roughly equivalent complexity, thus the points are equally weighted (i.e. we will count each task as 1 point). 

For our MVP, we anticipate roughly 10 technical tasks for user stories. Given a velocity of 5 (which we selected since we have 6 members and 5 is roughly equal), we should take 2 iterations. Note that this does not include some of our stretch goal features, including creating user accounts and tracking games. There will also likely be additional stories for testing and CI/CD infrastructure.

## Milestone #1 Game Pages

**Anticipated Velocity:** 5

**Actual Velocity:** X

**Tasks:** Each will have 1 primary task holder, listed below. Most tasks will be done in pairs.
- 33: Ibrahim (pair: Michelle)
- 34: Michelle (pair: Ibrahim)
- 35: Lin (pair: Khaled)
- 36: Khaled (pair: Lin)
- 37: Tuan (pair: Abhishek)
- 44: Abhishek (pair: Tuan)

Summary: 
- We have a basic webpage that lists all games on the homepage
- Each individual game is clickable to get all related news
- We created middleware for the database so all of our apps have an API to interact with the database
- Database has been created and initialized in all environments
- Testing (see section below for elabortion)
  - Integration tests are in the works
  - All contributions of this iteration were tested manually and with unit tests

**Testing**

We have created unit tests for all components developed so far. Tests are built with Gradle and invoked every time we push via Github Actions.
