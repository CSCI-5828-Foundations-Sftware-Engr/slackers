The expectations and driven by the requirements of the user stories. 

## Iteration 1

https://github.com/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/slackers/issues/5
https://github.com/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/slackers/issues/6

### Plan: 
1. Home page should show a list of games. 
2. Clicking on game tile should navigate to a single game page

### Result:
1. Games are listed
2. Clicking on game tile navigates to game page. 

### Conclusion: 
Accepted

### Additional Observations:
1. Randomized images, this is not planned behavior and should be revisited
2. There is a news headline but is not shown.

## Iteration 2

https://github.com/CSCI-5828-Foundations-Sftware-Engr/slackers/issues/28

### Plan: 
1. Single game page should have news section in the second half of the page
2. It should list five recent articles

### Result:
Accepted

### Observations
While functionality is all there, there are a couple formatting issues we are working to address:
- News information is sometimes displayed outside of the bounding box
- New box sizes can be inconsistent
